# New Branch of the Code

This GitHub repository contains the new branch of MOGPy code, which is currently under development.

## Objective

The goal of this new branch is to make significant improvements to the existing MOGPy code, focusing on the following points:

- Code refactoring using an object-oriented approach.
- Integration of unit tests to ensure code quality and reliability.
- Comply with PEP8 standards and eliminate major errors.
- Exploring the use of multiprocessing to make code more scalable.

## Current Progress

At this point, the new branch of MOGPy code is under development, and the main code is contained in the `MOGPy_app.py` file.
It is important to note that the current code is a rework that may not include all the functionality of the original code due to time constraints. 
However, the main goal is to provide quality and functional code.
